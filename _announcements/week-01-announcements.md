title: Week 1 - Welcome to EECS C106B/206B!

We're extremely excited to have you! It's going to be a great semester. We've spent a lot of time revamping the content, and we hope you will gain a lot out of this advanced robotics course. 106B/206B really pushes the envelope by diving into open research problems, building off the foundation established by 106A/206A. 

**This week:**
- Homework 1 released
- Project 1 released
- Discussion 1
- 106A Assessment (for those who haven't taken 106A)
- Optional Project 0
