Hi! I’m Daniel, I’m a grad student in the School of Information. I graduated last year with a degree in Data Science, concentration in Robotics. My current research is in autonomous vehicles i.e. drones and rovers with Professor Sastry and STAC. I love my couch, Netflix, and Disney Plus. Good luck this semester!
